# Remarks on PageRank for task 5 : 
# What do you observe ? Do you see flaws, or ways that this algorithm can be improved ?
# Other remarks

This algorithm is heavy to run, since it requires :
- to create dictionnaries at each step
- this requires a lot of iterations between map and reduce phases
- this typically cannot be parallelized, since it's by definition a sequential process
- crawlers can be really slow in practice

We are considering the full state of the graph, so in terms of memory, at scale, this kind of approach requires a enormous storage capacity.
